"""Vendorized dependencies.

Color has been moved from pydantic to pydantic-extra-types.  However, we can't easily
require pydantic-extra-types because it pins pydantic to >2.0.0.  So, in order to
retain compatibility with pydantic 1.x and 2.x without getting the color warning, and
without accidentally pinning pydantic, we vendor the two Color classes here.
