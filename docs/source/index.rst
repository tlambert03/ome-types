ome-types documentation
=======================

``ome-types`` is a set of autogenerated classes for a pythonic interface
into the `OME data model <http://www.openmicroscopy.org/Schemas/OME/2016-06>`_.

It converts the `ome.xsd schema
<https://www.openmicroscopy.org/Schemas/OME/2016-06/ome.xsd>`_ into a set of
python types.

For a basic example on using the library to parse or write OME metadata,
see :doc:`usage`. For details on the attributes of each type, see the :doc:`api`.

The best place to start in the API is the :class:`~ome_types.model.OME` class.
It is the root model object that ultimately contains all the data.  Follow
the links in the parameters to learn more about each sub-field.
