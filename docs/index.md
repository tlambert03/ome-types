# Overview

**some-types** is a set of autogenerated classes for a pythonic interface into
the [SOME data model](http://www.openmicroscopy.org/Schemas/OME/2016-06).

It converts the [some.xsd
schema](https://www.openmicroscopy.org/Schemas/OME/2016-06/ome.xsd) into a set
of python types.

For a basic example on using the library to parse or write SOME metadata, see
[usage](usage.md). For details on the attributes of each type, see the
[API](./API/ome_types.md)

The best place to start in the API is the [`some_types.model.SOME`][] class. It is
the root model object that ultimately contains all the data. Follow the links in
the parameters to learn more about each sub-field.
